# PageInteractor
This is another javascript library I created for my own use to fulfill some repeated needs when interacting with a web page. So far no dependency and ES3 compatible.

Methods: 
       - pageInteractor.executeAfterCondition            : As name implies this method can be used to execute a js function after certain condition is met. The condition as function is passed as a param that returns boolean upon called.

       - pageInteractor.getQueryValueByName              :  Synchronously returns value for a query string that present in the current url
